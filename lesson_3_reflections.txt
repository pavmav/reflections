When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when i'm working with a team or from different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    i want remote repository to stay logically whole even if i try to introduce a feature that takes more than 1 commit. especially
	if i'm working not alone

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork is clone on github. clone is copy from anywhere to my computer. branch is like fork but inside one repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    i can have that information offline

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    by sending files to a moderator. no need to learn VC, more work for  the moderator.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    if i'm working on an experimental feature or on any feature in a big project and want master branch to stay stable. first is more
	stable and flexible, second is easier and faster.
